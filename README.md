k8s is the current de facto standard in the cloud-native field.   
Thanks to Google's ingenious design, k8s can meet almost all cloud-native scenarios, but it brings a huge threshold for
beginners.

Based on the minimal system learning methodology, we start from the very beginning.   
Commit starts to see how one of the most sophisticated k8s is designed and implemented.

The implementation of k8s is exquisite and complex, and it is a master in the field of golang.   
Learning it well is not only very helpful for work,   
but also can better understand the current business scenarios such as cloud computing and cloud native.

I hope everyone who comes into contact with k8s can gain a lot.

This is my [study notes](./docs/notes.md) in Chinese.
